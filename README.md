This week we’ll be loading all of the objects and monsters that we parsed last week.
Add a class for instances of objects in the dungeon; remember that last week’s assignment created a
class for descriptions of objects, not instances of objects. There are 8 sets of dice in our object descriptions.
Of these, only damage should remain dice in an object instance. All others get rolled to become integers.
I’ll leave it up to you to figure out how to appropriately bring in the other fields from a description to an
instance.
Add a method or methods to your object description class to generate dynamic instances of objects.
A method that generates instances of a class is known as a factory, so our object description class is now
an object factory. Similarly add a method or methods to generate instances of npc. npc (and probably
character will need to be extended to handle all the new fields. Like object instances, only damage will
remain dice when instanced.
Upon generating instances, place them in the dungeon. In the case of characters, this means extending
or replacing the current monster generation routines. Objects must go on the floor, but they can be walked
over, so there’s no need to, e.g., check for a monster before placing an object.
I/O routines must be updated to render the new monsters and objects appropriately with colors. In order
to render with color in curses, you must take the following steps (all of which is already done in my code in
the implementation of the message queue):
1. Initialize the curses color subsystem by calling start color() when you initialize curses.
2. Color attributes are stored as numbered pairs in curses, each having a background color and a foreground color. Since there are 8 colors, this makes 64 color pairs; numbering starts from one, and we’ll
need only seven of them. Black on black cannot be read (the character is invisible), so if an object or
monster is defined to be black, we’ll render it white. Define a color pair with int init pair(short
pair, short f, short b) For example, to initialize the cyan pair, I used: init pair(COLOR CYAN,
COLOR CYAN, COLOR BLACK). Hint: The first parameter is the integer that curses uses to index the pair
and the colors themselves are integers, so if you use the same constant for the integer as you do for
the foreground color, you can always specify colors by name without an extra lookup table.
3. To render in color, call attron(COLOR PAIR(index)), render your symbol, and turn the color attribute off with attroff(COLOR PAIR(index)). If you take my hint above, you can, for example,
render in blue by specifying the attribute attron(COLOR PAIR(COLOR BLUE)).
Some monsters have multiple colors. You may use the first color only. An implementation of multicolored monsters will use a flickering effect to move between colors, but the actual implementation is outside
the scope of this class. My solution will implement it. Yours may if you like and have time (hint: look into
the select() system call).
When a character moves over an object, the character should be rendered, but the object should remain
in place so that when the character moves the object is rendered once again.
Load at least 20 objects per dungeon level. Don’t forget to clean up and properly deallocate objects and
monsters when leaving a dungeon level or quiting the game.
Select which monster or object to create by uniformly selecting a random description from your vectors
of descriptions when you generate the dungeon and generating an instance of the selected object.
The following table provides a mapping of object types to symbols. Optionally, you may allow objects
to stack (not required, which is what “optionally” means, but somebody will ask). If you choose not to do it,
then ignore the “stacks” symbol. If you do choose to allow stacks, devise a consistent way to select a stack’s
color, for instance, by using the color of the top object in the stack.

What follows is optional.
There are a handful of new monster abilities: the ability to pass through walls, the ability to pick up
objects, and the ability to destroy objects. Telepathic pass-wall monsters will always move toward the PC
as if walls were not there; there is no additional cost for these monsters when moving through walls. Nontelepathic pass-wall monsters can pass through walls while moving to a location where they have seen the
PC. Monsters that can pick up objects will always pick up when they pass over an object on the dungeon
floor. This object will then enter the monster’s inventory and be dropped when the monster dies. Monsters
that destroy objects will always destroy any object that they pass over.
Of course, since this is optional, you may modify it however you like.
